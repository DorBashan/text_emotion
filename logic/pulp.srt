00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,236
Vincent?

3
00:00:00,305 --> 00:00:03,001

4
00:00:03,074 --> 00:00:05,008
[ Sighs ]

5
00:00:05,076 --> 00:00:09,376
[ Brett ] Look, I'm sorry, uh, l--

00:00:09,447 --> 00:00:12,644
I got yours. Vincent. Right?

00:00:12,717 --> 00:00:18,053

ain't talkin' your way outta this shit.
- No, no, no.

8
00:00:19,524 --> 00:00:22,459
I just want you
to know how--

00:00:25,096 --> 00:00:28,588
I just want you to know how sorry we are
th-that things got so fucked up...

00:00:28,667 --> 00:00:30,862
with us and Mr. Wallace.

11
00:00:30,936 --> 00:00:35,430
W-We got into this thing with
the best intentions. Really. I never--

12
00:00:35,507 --> 00:00:38,908
Oh, I'm sorry,
did I break your concentration?

13
00:00:38,977 --> 00:00:41,571
- [ Gasping ]
- I didn't mean to do that. Please.

14
00:00:41,646 --> 00:00:46,811
Continue. You were saying something
about "best intentions."

15
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:52,122
What's the matter?
Oh, you were finished!

16
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:54,920
Oh, well, allow me to retort.

17
00:00:58,463 --> 00:01:01,455

look like?

18
00:01:01,533 --> 00:01:03,728

19
00:01:03,802 --> 00:01:07,067

00:01:07,138 --> 00:01:11,404

27
00:01:30,195 --> 00:01:32,527
- Go on!

28
00:01:32,597 --> 00:01:35,327
- Does he look like a bitch?
- What?

29
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,992
- [ Gunshot ]
- [ Screaming ]

30
00:01:37,068 --> 00:01:41,095
Does he look... Iike a bitch?

31
00:01:41,172 --> 00:01:44,403

- Then why you tryin'
to fuck him like a bitch?

32
00:01:44,476 --> 00:01:48,105
- I didn't.
- Yes, you did. Yes, you did, Brett!

33
00:01:48,179 --> 00:01:50,340
- You tried to fuck him.
- [ Gasping ] No, no.

34
00:01:50,415 --> 00:01:55,682
But Marsellus Wallace don't like to be
fucked by anybody except Mrs. Wallace.

35
00:01:55,754 --> 00:01:58,814
- You read the Bible, Brett?
- Yes!

36
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:03,452
Well, there's this passage
I got memorized. Sort of
fits this occasion.

37
00:02:03,528 --> 00:02:05,860
Ezekiel 25:17.

38
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:09,229
"The path of the righteous man...

39
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:13,237
is beset on all sides
by the inequities of the selfish...

40
00:02:13,305 --> 00:02:16,240
and the tyranny of evil men.

41
00:02:16,308 --> 00:02:21,245
Blessed is he who,
in the name of charity and goodwill,

42
00:02:21,313 --> 00:02:24,476
shepherds the weak
through the valley of darkness,

43
00:02:24,549 --> 00:02:27,211
for he is truly
his brother's keeper...

44
00:02:27,285 --> 00:02:30,846
and the finder
of lost children.

45
00:02:30,922 --> 00:02:34,722
And I will strike down upon thee
with great vengeance...

46
00:02:34,793 --> 00:02:36,761
and furious anger...

47
00:02:36,828 --> 00:02:41,492
those who attempt to poison
and destroy My brothers!

48
00:02:41,566 --> 00:02:45,400
And you will know
My name is the Lord...

49
00:02:45,470 --> 00:00:00,000
when I lay My vengeance
upon thee!"
