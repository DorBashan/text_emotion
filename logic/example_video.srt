1
00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:03,030
Why not?

2
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:10,639
Why not? Maybe--maybe she's right. You know, maybe I should have put it in the paper, maybe I should have done something different

3
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:17,868
The thing is, if you just do stuff and nothing happens

4
00:00:20,419 --> 00:00:24,099
What's it all mean? what's the point?

5
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:30,000
Oh right, this this whole thing is about self-acceptance

6
00:00:31,369 --> 00:00:35,859
Kicking the hell out of yourself doesn't give meaning to anything

7
00:00:35,859 --> 00:00:36,829
So I should stop?

8
00:00:36,829 --> 00:00:38,269
judging

9
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:41,890
and accept to start

10
00:00:42,019 --> 00:00:44,019
So no matter what I do

11
00:00:44,899 --> 00:00:48,308
Hurray for me because I'm a great guy? It's all good?

12
00:00:49,729 --> 00:00:56,769
No matter how many dogs I kill I just, what, do an inventory and accept

13
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:02,780
I mean you backed your truck over your own kid, and you like accept?

14
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:06,000
What a load of crap.

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Hey, Jessie, I know you're in pain--

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
No, y-you know what?

17
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,200
Why I'm here in the first place

18
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,200
Is to sell you meth

19
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:24,990
You're nothing to me, but customers!

20
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:37,000
I made you my bitch! You okay with that? Huh? You accept?

21
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:40,940
No.

22
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:53,080
About time.

23
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:05,610
Jesse! Stop what you're doing, turn and face me!

24
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:10,530
You wanna--you wanna know what he did?

25
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:13,050
You wanna hear about it?

26
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:15,920
Jesse! Put out the lighter.

27
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,920
He poisoned a little kid

28
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:24,340
An eight year old boy just because, you know, just as a move!

29
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:25,460
Now Walt's a bastard.

30
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:29,760
Secret's out, we'll talk about it. I need you to put out the lighter

31
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,540
Jesse--

32
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:39,360
See I don't wanna kill you, and you don't want to be killed.

33
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,440
So put it out.

34
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,800
He can't keep getting away with it!

35
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,300
 

36
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:53,600
He can't keep getting away with it!

37
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,500
You wanna burn him down?

38
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,120
Let's do it together.

39
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,480
Back off!

40
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:22,000
You stay where you are what I don't know what happened here what I do.

41
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,360
You stole it off from me

42
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,360
You and him just took it right out of my pocket

43
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:33,540
Calm down. Yes, okay. I had him lift your dope, I couldn't risk the gun out take it you No! Before

44
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:37,420

45
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:40,700
cigarette what the ricin cigarette

46
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:46,420
You and him stole it off me.. and over here that Mr. White

47
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:50,400
He poisoned Brock! You poison Brock to you

48
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:53,940
You helped him, okay, Jesse?

49
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:55,940
Calm down. Say it again

50
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,360
Tell me one more time to calm down, come on. I'm sorry just

51
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:06,700
Yes, okay, I heard he will lift your cigarette. What maybe he told me he was helping you. He was saving you

52
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:09,789
I never would have a great time. I know what he was gonna do

53
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:12,580
God believe me. I didn't wanna any of this

54
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:26,150
Back up

55
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:29,689
You're turning down one and a half

56
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:36,379
Million dollars, I'm not turning down the money. I'm turning down

57
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:38,700

58
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:40,700
You get it I?

59
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:43,790
I don't want nothing to do with you

60
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:52,009
Ever since I met you everything I've ever cared about

61
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,400
It's gone

62
00:04:56,340 --> 00:05:04,129
Ruined , turned to shit, dead ever since I hooked up with the great Heisenberg

63
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:08,569
Have never been more alone

64
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:13,400
I have nothing, no one

65
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:18,559
All right, it's all gone get it?

66
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:23,750
No no no why

Why would you

68
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:34,759
Get it. What do you even care as long as you get what's you want?

69
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,240

70
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:41,540
Don't give a shit about me

71
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:46,039
You said I was no good

72
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,720
I'm nothing

73
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:52,579
Why would you want me, huh?

74
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,980
You said my meth

75
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:58,060

00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:18,560

What happened happened for the best, do you hear me

00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:26,939
I wouldn't change it you and I working together

94
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:30,570
Having each other's back

95
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:33,180
It's what saved our lives

96
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,580
I want you to think about that as we go forward

97
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,040
Go forward where

98
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:57,180
Do it

Nothing happens until I hear you say it

103
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:24,180
I want this

104
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:49,660
